# Body_Energy_Club_Java_Personal_Project

JAVA project that implements persistence. User can select ingredients for their smoothie such as the fruit, milk, protein type etc. and see the MACROS for their selection.
This project was inspired by the time I spent working in a smoothie store that summer. I wanted to impleneted their software on a simpler scale by myself.
